# Chunaav

Despite the proliferation of neutral election observers and the advancement of certain voting technologies, there is still no globally accepted way to verify electronic voting as 100% accurate. 

The name of our solution, ‘CHUNAAV’, roughly translating to choice in English is what elections have taken away from citizens because of errors in the system of maintaining voters lists and for the actual process of counting the votes while keeping the system secure, and we plan to change that.

Our goal for this project would be to first develop an automated method to first build and update the Azure’s distributed ledger which consists of the voter’s identification that can automatically add details of all the citizens who are eligible voters, to prevent any fraudulence with respect to the creation of Voter ID. 

The feature of our solution is that it automatically updates the list whenever anyone turns 18, by referring to the government's database of the date of birth. Then, a key is created by a combination of their ID along with their biometrics to make a unique cryptographic key that cannot be mimicked. 
As this is a key generated directly from the person’s ID and biometrics, it can be used from anywhere, even if they are not in their home constituency by a simple intuitive AI-based constituency transfer algorithm to shift voters names between different constituency lists.
Since it is auto-added, no one will ever be left out, and every single person born in India or with an Indian issued ID has a unique key to log in with and a specific voter's ID doesn't need to be physically stored but instead your biometrics define your ID using an in house multiple encryption algorithm.
With this generated key voting can be done on the blockchain, and these votes are mathematically validated, thus removing any loopholes and making each vote genuine and can be counted without the presence of a person, making it faster.
 
When a person is to cast their vote, using web scraping, we provide simple analytics and agendas for every nominee giving an insightful background on the eligible candidates.
